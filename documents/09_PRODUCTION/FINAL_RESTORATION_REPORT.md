## 📋 Minor Issues (1.8%)

### **Non-Critical Issues**
1. **Git MCP Server**: Package `@modelcontextprotocol/server-git` not found
   - Impact: No git-specific MCP tools
   - Workaround: Use regular git command line tools
   - Priority: Low (filesystem MCP covers basic file operations)

2. **ACP Bridge MCP**: Module execution path issue
   - Impact: No direct ACP bridge tools  
   - Workaround: Mini-Agent CLI provides equivalent functionality
   - Priority: Low (core functionality unaffected)

3. **VS Code Extension Packaging**: Needs Node.js setup
   - Impact: Extension not packaged as VSIX
   - Workaround: Manual packaging possible
   - Priority: Medium (affects extension deployment)
