# VS Code Extension Build Archive

## Purpose
These are archived VS Code extension build attempts (.vsix files) from the Zed Editor ACP integration research.

## Files
- `mini-agent-acp-1.0.0.vsix` - First build attempt
- `mini-agent-vscode-1.0.0.vsix` - Second build attempt  
- `mini-agent-acp-1.0.0-vscode.vsix` - Build from vscode-extension directory

## Status
❌ These builds **failed** - they did not successfully integrate with Zed editor via ACP.

## Context
Part of ongoing research to implement Agent Client Protocol (ACP) integration with Zed editor. This is a placeholder for future work.

Related directories:
- `/vscode-extension/` - Active VS Code extension development
- `/mini_agent/acp/` - ACP server implementation
- `/documents/experiments/zed_acp/` - Future Zed integration research

## Next Steps
When resuming Zed ACP integration work:
1. Review these failed attempts to understand issues
2. Check current ACP protocol specifications
3. Test with latest Zed editor version
4. Document learnings in `/documents/experiments/zed_acp/`

## Do Not Use
These files are for **reference only**. Do not attempt to install them.
For current VS Code extension, build from source in `/vscode-extension/`.
