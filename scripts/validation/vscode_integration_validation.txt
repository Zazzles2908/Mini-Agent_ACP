Use the fact-checking skill to validate this Mini-Agent VS Code integration implementation:

**Task**: Assess VS Code integration skill implementation against Mini-Agent architectural requirements

**Implementation Files to Validate**:
- `mini_agent/skills/vscode_integration/SKILL.md` - Skill documentation
- `mini_agent/skills/vscode_integration/scripts/vscode_integration.py` - Implementation

**Required Architecture Checks**:
1. Progressive skill loading: Level 1 (metadata) → Level 2 (full content) → Level 3 (resources)
2. Knowledge graph integration: Entities, Relations, Memory persistence
3. Skills directory structure: Proper location in mini_agent/skills/
4. Workspace organization: No polluting files in main directory
5. Native architecture compliance: Following intrinsic Mini-Agent design patterns

**Expected Validation**:
- Confirm progressive skill loading implementation
- Verify knowledge graph integration
- Validate skill structure and documentation
- Check workspace cleanliness
- Assess architectural alignment
